# P2ServiceSchedulingApp - Jonathan, Rahelly, Bruk, Tuan

## Project Description

Book your next hair appointment with the Cosmo App! Our Cosmo scheduling app will allow you to enjoy stressless booking at any time. Our CosmoUsers are able to view their favorite hairstylists' availability and make appointments while enjoying exclusive savings. The functionality of the application will be user friendly and easy to use. Once an account is created, our CosmoUsers can view the list of services and book a specific service with their desired CosmoTech. There should be no overbooking and no booking outside of business hours. Since our CosmoTechs make their own schedules, there is always time for your hair to be styled!
